    exploited and ways we can save them. </p></div>

    <h3 id="intro">Introduction: The World is In Trouble</h3>
</div>
<p>At this current rate, 70% of the Earth will be gone. How? Overfishing is when fisherman fish so much that fish cannot be made fast enough, 
    which depletes the fish population. According to Save Our Seas , "Overfishing occurs when fish and other marine species are caught faster 
    than they can reproduce. It is the result of growing demand for seafood around the world, combined with poor management of fisheries and
     the development of new, more effective fishing techniques. <b>If left unchecked, it will destroy the marine ecosystem and jeopardize the food 
     security of more than a billion people for whom fish are a primary source of protein."</b> This explains how overfishing works, and if overfishing 
     is continued, the world could be doomed with the destruction of 70% of the Earth.

    <h3 id="case">Case Study: The Bluefin Tuna Is Disappearing</h3></div>
    
    <p>This is a case study that shows the effect of what is happening right now because of 
        overfishing. According to Save Our Seas, "2009, WWF (World Wildlife Foundation)predicted 
        that without drastic measures, Atlantic bluefin will disappear by 2012. Unfortunately, 
        attempts to implement such measures—most recently at the 2010 Convention on International 
        Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)—have failed." This case study
         shows the effect of overfishing and how if we do not get fish sustainably, marine life 
         is doomed. This is why saving the oceans are important.</p>

<p>But do not fear! There are some ways to sustainably fish to help the environment survive. 
    If you can find fish found in these ways or more, you will be helping the environment. 
    According to Sunset.com, "Floating traps and weirs, which guide the fish into ever-smaller 
    boxes, harm neither fish nor the environment." This shows one of the ways that we can 
    sustainably fish, not hurting the environment that we have inhabited for 190 thousand 
    years (I am talking about homo sapiens).</p><br></div>

<ul>
    <li>View the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch, a sustainable list updated weekly that recommends shrimp!
    </li>
    <li>If it’s harvested in the United States, it is inherently sustainable as a result of the rigorous U.S. management process that ensures fisheries are continuously monitored, improved, and sustainable.
    </li>
    <li>Imported seafood can also be safe and sustainable, but comes from a variety of sources 
    </li>
    <li>ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT FISH!
    </li>
    <li>Buy seafood from reputable sources
    </li>
</ul>
